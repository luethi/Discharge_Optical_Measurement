#Welcome to the Discharge technology!
_measure Discharge with Webcam or Smartphone_
______

On these pages we explain to you how you can measure the discharge of a river, stream, furrow or channel with our image based 'Discharge' technology. The technology is based on imaging your river with either of:
* Fixed IP cameras and our system 'DischargeKeeper', available through [photrack](www.photrack.ch), send us an [email](mailto:info@photrack.ch) for a quote.
* Smartphone and our 'Android App' 'Discharge', available on [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps).  
Both tools are integrated with our web-backend site [discharge.ch](http://staging.discharge.ch).
