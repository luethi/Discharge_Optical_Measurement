#Welcome to the Discharge technology!
_Discharge with Webcam or Smartphone - accurate optical measurements_
______

These pages explain how you can measure the discharge of a river, stream, furrow or channel with our image based 'Discharge' technology. The technology is based on imaging your river with either of:
* 'DischargeKeeper', for fixed IP cameras, available through [photrack](www.photrack.ch), ask for a [quote](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
* 'Discharge' app for Android, available on [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps).
  
Both tools are integrated with our web-backend site [discharge.ch](http://staging.discharge.ch).
