# Choosing a site for Discharge Keeper

## Here is list of things to consider when choosing a site for a DischargeKeeper system:

1. Is the river reasonable straight?
2. By your own eyes, do you see which way the river is flowing at the particular site? If you are not sure, take a recording for 5sec with any digital imaging device, at a resolution 640x480 or better and send it to [photrack](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
3. Does the river section have a reasonable well defined cross-section? One that you can also measure?
4. Can you see the shore and can it be approximated as a planar surface? 
5. Are there at least 2 natural features on the far shore line, or will you have a way of permanently mounting such markers?
6. Can you estimate the bottom roughness (Strickler value, kst, or Manning value n=1/kst)?
7. Do you see of a way to mount a fixed camera (Is there a house? Could you mount a mast?)?
8. Will the camera not look to shallow onto the surface (>20DEG from horizontal) and is the field of view not too far away (d<100m)?
8. Do you have grid power? If not, you will need solar power and/or fuel cell, talk e.g. to [photrack](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
9. Will the setup be vandalism proof?
10. Do you have internet? If not, do you have reasonable GSM signal quality and strength, i.e. edge and better and 1/5 bars?

If you can answer all these questions with 'yes' please go to [Setting up a DischargeKeeper site](setup_keeper_site).
