# Choosing a site for Discharge Keeper

## Here is list of things to consider when choosing a site for a DischargeKeeper system:

Beat: group in app things and then discahrge keeper only things

1. Is the river section at your site reasonable straight?
2. By your own eyes, do you see which way the river is flowing at the particular site? If you are not sure if the visual signal from the surface is strong enough, take a recording for only 5sec with any digital imaging device, at a resolution 640x480 or better and send it to [photrack](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
3. Does the river section have a reasonable well defined cross-section? One that you can also measure?
4. Can you see the shore and can it be approximated as a planar surface? 
5. Are there at least 2 natural features on the far shore line, or do you have away of creating artificial markers (spray, paint, etc.)?
6. Will the camera not look at a too shallow angle onto the surface, >20deg from horizontal, and is the field of view not too far away, <100m (25m for app)?
_______
7. Do you see of a way to mount a fixed camera on a house, or could you mount a mast?
8. Do you have grid power? If not, you will need solar power and/or fuel cell to provide about 10Watt, talk e.g. to [photrack](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
9. Will the setup be vandalism proof?
10. Do you have internet? If not, do you have reasonable GSM signal quality and strength, i.e. edge and better and 1/5 bars?

## Next steps:
If you can answer all these questions with 'yes' please go to [Setting up a DischargeKeeper site](setup_keeper_site).

If you are in doubt about some points, please contact a human @[photrack](mailto:info@photrack.ch).
